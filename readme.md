Created some android apps like Coin-Man, Bluetooth Finder, Notes App and Hikers Watch.
In Coin-Man game, score of player is updated automatically when coins are touched by player
and game will over when player touches bomb. On touching screen player will jump and will
free fall after it until it reaches ground.
In Bluetooth Finder, App will search for nearer devices to it which could get connected through
bluetooth.
